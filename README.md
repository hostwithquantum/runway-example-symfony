# Runway Example symfony App

This is an example app demonstrating how to deploy a symfony app
to [runway](https://www.runway.horse/).

* clone this repo, and navigate into that directory
* `runway app create`
* `runway app deploy`
* `runway open`

You can then deploy changes by `git commit`ing them, and running `runway app
deploy` again.

This is the Symfony demo application (`6.1.x`), created with `composer create-project symfony/skeleton:"6.1.*" example-symfony-api`.
